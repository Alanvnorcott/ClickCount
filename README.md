This is my first deployed web app; It is a web stats tracker formatted much like a videogame. I built this to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and familiarize myself with Google's APIs. I had fun creating this small application and hope to push the needle further with each consecutive project. It is now on the Chrome store for download, so feel free to try it out and let me know what you think or if there are any issues. I plan to add more to this project and continually refine it as I start my next one.
